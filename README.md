# Algorithms

This repository contains solved tasks for the "Algorithms" course of Princeton University.

⚠️ Please, use the solutions in this repository to analyze problems in your own solutions, not to copy the code.

⚠️ Also, this code does not pretend to be a correct or optimal solution. All tasks were completed by me as I was able to complete them, with all possible shortcomings.
